    <p>
      Wassup readers!!! I am Makhi Crosland, I am 17 years old, and I'm a
      growing percuissionist. But I am one of the the Top Marching Snare Players
      in my class. If there were ratings in a drumming like there was in sports,
      I'd give myself a solid 4 stars. (not 5 because there's always room to
      grow). My background in drumline starts from the age of 5, when I started
      my drum career. Now at 17 years old, I am head section leader of my
      <strong> INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN </strong> drumline. For those who don't
      believe me, I'll list out just a few of the biggest things my drumline has
      done: <br />
