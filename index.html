    <p>
      Wassup readers!!! I am Makhi Crosland, I am 17 years old, and I'm a
      growing percuissionist. But I am one of the the Top Marching Snare Players
      in my class. If there were ratings in a drumming like there was in sports,
      I'd give myself a solid 4 stars. (not 5 because there's always room to
      grow). My background in drumline starts from the age of 5, when I started
      my drum career. Now at 17 years old, I am head section leader of my
      <strong> INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN </strong> drumline. For those who don't
      believe me, I'll list out just a few of the biggest things my drumline has
      done: <br />

    <h2>
      Here are 10 Helpful Tips
    </h2>
    
   <ol type="1">
     <li> Take the word <strong><u>CAN'T</u></strong> out your vocabulary</li>
     <li> Always ask questions <em>(your <strong>instructors</strong> and <strong>student leadership</strong> are there to help you. <mark> don't be afraid to ask for help</mark></em></li>
     <li> Try your best</li>
     <li> Never doubt your capabilities</li>
     <li> <strong> GO HOME AND PRACTICE</strong></li>
     <li> Always be on time!! (in the band world, <em> to be on time,</em> is to be <u>EARLY</u>)</li>
     <li> Practice at a slower tempo than the regular tempo</li>
     <li> Don't be afraid to <strong> BREAK DOWN YOUR MUSIC</strong> <em>(learning your music is not a race, as long as your music is learned, and you are trying to learn, your instructor will be pleased)</em> </li>

     <li> Last but not least, always have fun!! If this is your passion you should do it with some passion</li>

This doesn't just have to be for drummers, these are ways that you should your everyday, or any other passions take these same steps. It is what makes the great people, so great. they put time, dediction, and a positive mindset in what they do. With that being said, GOODBYE!!😉😎🎶😁
